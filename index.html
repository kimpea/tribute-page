                <p>Born in California in 1973, Paul Walker made his big-screen debut in the 1986 horror spoof Monster
                    in Your Closet. After appearing in several television shows in the 1990s, including Charles in
                    Charge, Who's the Boss? and The Young and the Restless, Walker gained attention with a role in the
                    1999 film Varsity Blues, and his TV days were officially behind him. After working in teen movies
                    such as She's All That and The Skulls, Walker got his breakthrough role in 2001 with The Fast and
                    the Furious, which would become his star vehicle and keep him busy through four sequels and a short
                    prequel. The Fast and the Furious franchise established Walker as an action-film mainstay, and he
                    went on to appear in several films in the genre, including Takers, Hours and Vehicle 19. Walker
                    died in a car accident on November 30, 2013, at age 40. <i>-- www.biography.com</i></p>
